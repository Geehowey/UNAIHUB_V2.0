# Contributing to UNAIHUB_V2.0

First off, thank you for considering contributing to UNAIHUB_V2.0! It's people like you that make UNAIHUB_V2.0 such a great tool.

## Ways to Contribute

There are many ways to contribute to UNAIHUB_V2.0, from writing tutorials or blog posts, improving the documentation, submitting bug reports and feature requests, or writing code which can be incorporated into UNAIHUB_V2.0 itself.

### Reporting Bugs

This section guides you through submitting a bug report. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report, reproduce the behavior, and find related reports.

- Use the GitHub Issues search — check if the issue has already been reported.
- If the issue has not been reported, create a new issue.
- Be sure to include a title and clear description, as much relevant information as possible, and a code sample or an executable test case demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

### Feature Requests

Feature requests are welcome. But take a moment to find out whether your idea fits with the scope and aims of the project. It's up to _you_ to make a strong case to convince the project's maintainers of the merits of this feature. Please provide as much detail and context as possible.

### Pull Requests

Good pull requests—patches, improvements, new features—are a fantastic help. They should remain focused in scope and avoid containing unrelated commits.

**Please ask first** before embarking on any significant pull request (e.g., implementing features, refactoring code), otherwise you risk spending a lot of time working on something that the project's maintainers might not want to merge into the project.

Here are a few important guidelines:

1. Please create a GitHub issue to discuss the changes before starting to work on your pull request.
2. Open a new issue in the GitHub Issue tracker.
3. Fork the repo.
4. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`).
5. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`).
6. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`).
7. Create a new Pull Request.
